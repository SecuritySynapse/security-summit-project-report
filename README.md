# Security Summit Project Report

The purpose of this repository is to house your final report for the security
summit project in the advanced computer security course. Please study the
`writing/report.md` file for more details about the steps that you should take
to furnish a final report on your security summit project.

After cloning this repository to your computer, please take the following steps:

- Answer all of the following questions inside of the `report.md` file so that
you can document and reflect on your experiences during the crafting of the
research proposal, the initial implementation phases of the security summit
project, rounds or multiple demonstrations that you gave to the course
instructor during a laboratory session or an office hours appointment, the
completion of your status update, the presentation of your work in a lightning
talk, and the completion of all final project deliverables.
- Please note that you are required to answer all of the questions and submit
the final version of the `report.md` file by the recorded deadline. Importantly,
you can find the deadline for the work in this repository by clicking the button
that is at the top of this file!
- You will have the opportunity to work on this final report during at least one
of the afternoon laboratory sessions.
- If you have not done so already, please make sure that you schedule office
hour appointments with the course instructor to share final status updates and
to seek feedback about the implementation and evaluation of the security summit
project and the completion of the final report.
- Please see the course instructor if you have any questions or concerns about
any of the tasks you are invited to complete as a part of this final report.
