# Final Report for the Security Summit Project

## Project Overview

This long-term project invites you to propose, implement, evaluate, and present
your own advanced project in the field of computer security. In addition to
requiring the completion of a significant and innovative software tool, this
project invites you to complete a series of presentations and reports. Your
long-term project should clearly demonstrate a "security synapse" both through
the connection between high-level concepts and their low-level implementation
and technical concepts discussed in the course and their practical application
to the secure use of real-world computer software. You may use external sources,
including artificial intelligence coding assistants and online forums, during
the completion of this project provided that you cite these sources and explain
how you used them to complete the various components of your long-term project.

## final report Instructions

Provide a brief final reports about your progress on the security summit
project. Please note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository
has a passing build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have
adequately answered all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to
each of them. It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory
answers to all of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment
of your security synapse project's final report.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive final report for your security synapse project.

## Security Summit Project report

### Add Your Name Here

TODO: Make sure to include your name in the above heading.

### Summary Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each report task that you completed

TODO: Please do not fill in the checkbox if you did not complete the task

- [] Stated the final topic and gave the final title for your project
- [] Reviewed the scientific and engineering goals for your project
- [] Assessed how well the project achieved its scientific and engineering goals
- [] Described each of the key components within the implemented software tool
- [] Documented the design of the experiment that you conducted for evaluation
- [] Using tables of data and/or graphs, reported on the experimental results
- [] Documented the challenges that you faced and how you overcame them
- [] Summarized the projectâ€™s contributions and suggested areas for future work

### Project Report

#### What is the final topic that you selected for your security summit project?

TODO: Write one or two sentences that offer an overview of your topic, explain
what you are going to build, and describe how you are going to evaluate it. What
you furnish in this sub-section of the report should include a few more
details than the topic list that you provided in the previous sub-section.

- **Chosen Topic**: 
- **Final Title**:

#### What are the ways in which your project's topic evolved since its proposal?

TODO: Write a brief one-paragraph description of how your project's topic
evolved since you first proposed it. This response should explain how your
project's topic changed from both a high-level perspective and in terms of the
specific technical details that are central to the completion of your project.

#### What are the scientific and/or engineering goals for your chosen project?

TODO: Provide a list of at least three goals for your chosen project. Each goal
that you provide should have a clear noun and verb. Whenever it is possible to
do so, please make sure that you do not write any of these goals in passive
voice as that would obscure the overall contributions of your project.

#### What is the final version of the abstract of your project?

TODO: Write a brief one-paragraph abstract that overviews your long-term project
and the expected outcomes. The content that you write here should be written and
formatted like the abstract of a scientific paper published in an ACM or IEEE
conference in the field of computer security. The one different between an
abstract that you read in a published research paper and this abstract is that
the one you are writing here will reference expected research results and a
published paper will explain the results from a completed study.

#### Please pick one source code segment from your final tool and explain it.

TODO: Using your project's chosen implementation language, please provide a
source code segment in a fenced code block. Then, write at least one paragraph
that explains the key features of the code segment that you have already
implemented. When appropriate, explain what was technically challenging and/or
interesting about the provided source code segment. Please make sure that you
pick a code segment that is different that one you highlighted previously.

#### What is some preliminary experimental evidence arising from your project?

TODO: Write a response with one or two paragraphs that overview an interesting
empirical study that you have conducted and result arising from it. Whenever
possible, your response to this question should furnish data (through a fenced
code block or a table) that supports the claims that you are making about
various aspects of the efficiency, effectiveness, or security of your approach.
